# Architecture and ownership

## Entry points and lifetimes

Public callers enter through [`Application`](../src/mermaiden/application.py); command-line compatibility checks enter
through [`mermaiden.cli`](../src/mermaiden/cli.py). Both use the cached process scope created by
[`bootstrap.process_scope()`](../src/mermaiden/bootstrap.py). An `Application` is a lightweight handle: closing it
invalidates that handle, while the shared dependency scope remains process-owned. Diagram models are transient; scoped
services share that process scope.

## Layers and dependencies

- [`core`](../src/mermaiden/core) owns diagram values, validation reports, character policies, and neutral naming.
- [`runtime`](../src/mermaiden/runtime) owns generic aggregate state, structural constraints, transactions, and snapshot
  encoding. It depends on core, not on a concrete diagram feature.
- [`diagrams`](../src/mermaiden/diagrams) owns the concrete syntax features and the catalog assembled from their explicit
  descriptors. Concrete feature packages are independent and may share diagram concepts only through `diagrams.shared`.
- [`mutations`](../src/mermaiden/mutations) validates and dispatches public command payloads against the catalog.
- [`mermaid`](../src/mermaiden/mermaid) owns Mermaid configuration compatibility, Jinja templates, source rendering,
  previews, and optional `mmdc` validation.
- [`application.py`](../src/mermaiden/application.py) is the public facade; [`bootstrap.py`](../src/mermaiden/bootstrap.py)
  is the only composition root. The [import-linter contract](../.importlinter) enforces feature independence.

## Single sources of truth

| Concern | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Supported diagrams, objects, configuration type, commands, and snapshot properties | Each concrete model's `DiagramDefinition` and `DiagramFeature` in [`diagrams`](../src/mermaiden/diagrams); [`DiagramsApplication`](../src/mermaiden/diagrams/application.py) is the runtime registry and [`DiagramCatalog`](../src/mermaiden/diagrams/catalog/service.py) derives discovery schemas from it. |
| Mermaid version and upstream configuration schema | [`schema.lock.json`](../src/mermaiden/mermaid/compatibility/schema.lock.json) pins the version, source URL, and checksum; [`config.schema.json`](../src/mermaiden/mermaid/compatibility/schemas/config.schema.json) is the checked content and [`configuration_overrides.json`](../src/mermaiden/mermaid/compatibility/configuration_overrides.json) records reviewed differences. |
| Feature configuration | The configuration class named by each `DiagramFeature`; compatibility is checked against the locked upstream schema. |
| Snapshot envelope and type identities | `SNAPSHOT_VERSION` in [`runtime/snapshot/domain.py`](../src/mermaiden/runtime/snapshot/domain.py), the matching [`schema.v7.json`](../src/mermaiden/runtime/snapshot/schema.v7.json), and registry-derived discriminators in [`DiagramSnapshotRegistry`](../src/mermaiden/diagrams/services/snapshot_registry.py). |
| Dependency composition and lifetime | [`bootstrap.py`](../src/mermaiden/bootstrap.py). |
| Compatibility fixtures | [`FixtureCatalog`](../tests/fixtures/catalog.py) combines test-owned fixture builders and requires exactly one populated fixture for every runtime-registered syntax. |
| Mermaid templates | [`templates/syntax`](../src/mermaiden/mermaid/templates/syntax), checked against the runtime catalog by [`MermaidTemplateOwnership`](../src/mermaiden/mermaid/templates/ownership.py). |
| Shared primitives | [`ClassName`](../src/mermaiden/core/naming.py) owns class naming and [`Direction`](../src/mermaiden/diagrams/shared/direction.py) owns shared diagram direction. Feature-specific flow types remain in their features. |
| Python and Mermaid tool dependencies | Runtime and development declarations live in [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml); [`uv.lock`](../uv.lock) fixes Python resolution and [`package-lock.json`](../package-lock.json) fixes the Mermaid CLI. |
| Generated mutation documentation | [`contract.json`](contracts/diagram-mutations/contract.json) and its matrices, regenerated only with [`make mutation-contract`](../Makefile) through [`render_mutation_contract.py`](../scripts/render_mutation_contract.py). |

## I/O boundaries

The package reads its checked-in Mermaid schema and templates while rendering or checking compatibility. Persistent output
is written only through caller-requested preview operations. `Application.validate_render()` owns its temporary files and
is the external-process boundary that invokes the locked Mermaid CLI; ordinary source generation does not invoke a browser,
npm, or Mermaid executable.
