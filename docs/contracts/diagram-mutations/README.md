# Diagram mutation contract

This documentation is generated from `contract.json` and `diagrams/*.json`.
Run `make mutation-contract` after changing the machine-readable sources.

Contract version: `1`.

## Classifications

| Classification | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `updateable` | Public semantic field; partial update preserves object identity. |
| `move_or_reorder_only` | Containment and order are owned by move/reorder commands. |
| `immutable` | Stable object identity or concrete kind. |

## Semantics

- **Stable identity.** Object IDs and concrete kinds are immutable; the required kind discriminator must match the selected object and every update and move preserves both.
- **Partial update.** Only fields in changes are replaced; omitted fields retain their current values.
- **Null.** Explicit null is accepted only when the selected public field schema is nullable.
- **Strict payloads.** Unknown payload and change fields are rejected before dispatch; changes contains at least one field.
- **Move.** Moving changes only direct containment and position, preserves the complete subtree, rejects cycles and incompatible parents, uses an empty parent_id for root, accepts positions 0..N after removing the target, and appends when position is omitted.
- **Reorder.** Reordering requires an exact, duplicate-free permutation of the selected root or container's current direct member IDs; an empty parent_id selects root.
- **Retarget.** Relation members and annotation targets are ordered, preserve the owning object ID, and run existing reference, cardinality, kind, uniqueness, and diagram constraints.
- **No-op.** An unchanged patch, current placement, or current exact order is accepted without changing rendered or persisted state.
- **Atomic rejection.** Argument, operation, constraint, and unexpected failures restore the byte-for-byte snapshot that existed before the command.
- **Invalid pre-state.** Update, move, and reorder commit only when the resulting state can commit, even when the pre-state was already invalid.
- **Discovery.** Each supported operation has one name and a strict JSON-shaped schema discoverable through diagram_description and command_payload.

## Commands

| Operation | Applies to | Required payload | Strictness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `update_element` | elements | `id`, `kind`, `changes` | unknown fields rejected |
| `update_relation` | relations | `id`, `kind`, `changes` | unknown fields rejected |
| `update_annotation` | annotations | `id`, `kind`, `changes` | unknown fields rejected |
| `move_element` | elements | `id`, `kind`, `parent_id` | unknown fields rejected |
| `reorder_elements` | root and container direct element collections | `parent_id`, `element_ids` | unknown fields rejected |

Dynamic schema sources:

- `object.id_schema`: The selected object's public id property schema.
- `object.kind_const`: A string const containing the selected catalogued object kind.
- `object.updateable_field_schemas`: The selected object's public property schemas whose matrix classification is updateable.
