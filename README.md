# mermaiden

`mermaiden` generates deterministic Mermaid source from typed Python diagram models. It supports the Mermaid syntax families registered by the package and validates each diagram before rendering its text.

The package produces Mermaid text only. Render it with Mermaid in a browser, Markdown viewer, or your own CLI workflow.

## Installation

Python 3.12 or later is required.

```sh
pip install mermaiden
```

The wheel declares and installs its Python dependencies. The `compat` CLI command needs no additional tools.
Full SVG validation through `Application.validate_render()` shells out to the `mmdc` executable and requires a
compatible browser. Development installs the exact Mermaid CLI version from `package-lock.json`; set
`PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` when using a system browser.

## Quick start

<!-- executable-example:discovery:start -->
```python
from mermaiden import Application

with Application.create() as application:
    diagrams = application.available_diagrams()
    sequence = application.diagram_info("sequenceDiagram")
    description = application.diagram_description(sequence.id)
    payload_type = application.command_payload(sequence.id, "add_participant")
    payload = payload_type.validate({"id": "api", "label": "API", "kind": "control"})

    assert sequence in diagrams
    assert "add_participant" in description.commands
    assert payload.values["kind"] == "control"
```
<!-- executable-example:discovery:end -->

`Application.available_diagrams()` returns the supported diagram catalog. `Application.diagram_info(diagram_id)` returns the typed diagram API for an individual syntax. CLI workflows are available through `python -m mermaiden.cli`.

The [architecture and ownership map](docs/architecture.md) identifies the layers, entry points, lifetimes, and
authoritative files behind that catalog.

## Application API

`Application` is the boundary for API and persistence adapters. Each handle uses the process-owned scope created once by
the bootstrap module; use it as a context manager or call `close()` to invalidate that handle. Create a diagram by
Mermaid syntax id, apply a named domain command, and persist the JSON-safe snapshot returned by the application.

<!-- executable-example:application:start -->
```python
from mermaiden import Application

with Application.create() as application:
    diagram = application.create_diagram("sequenceDiagram")
    change = application.apply_batch(
        diagram,
        (
            {"operation": "add_participant", "arguments": {"id": "client", "label": "Client"}},
            {"operation": "add_participant", "arguments": {"id": "api", "label": "API"}},
            {
                "operation": "add_message",
                "arguments": {
                    "id": "request",
                    "source_id": "client",
                    "target_id": "api",
                    "label": "Request",
                },
            },
        ),
    )
    assert change.can_commit

    payload = application.snapshot(diagram).to_dict()
    restored = application.restore(payload)
    source = application.render(restored)
    report = application.validate_render(restored)
    if not report.success:
        raise RuntimeError(report.diagnostics)
    svg = report.svg
```
<!-- executable-example:application:end -->

`apply_batch()` accepts an ordered sequence of `{"operation": str, "arguments": mapping}` objects. It validates command
payloads as usual, defers whole-diagram constraint inspection until the batch is complete, and restores the exact
pre-batch snapshot if any command or the final validation fails. An empty batch leaves the diagram unchanged and returns
its current validation report.

`validate_render()` is non-mutating and runs Mermaid's complete rendering and layout phase through `mmdc`; its report
contains the compatible Mermaid version, SVG output, and structured diagnostics.

Snapshots have a versioned envelope and may be stored as JSON. Version 6 uses registry-owned discriminators such as
`mermaiden/element/classDiagram/class`; snapshots never contain importable Python module paths. Its closed envelope
schema is published at `src/mermaiden/runtime/snapshot/schema.v6.json`. Earlier and unknown versions are rejected;
there is no implicit migration or compatibility reader. Newly created and incomplete diagrams are marked as drafts:
callers may snapshot and restore them between accepted commands, but `Application.render()` rejects them until their
blocking constraints are resolved. Snapshot parsing and typed hydration reject malformed persisted data, and
restoration verifies snapshots that were recorded as valid. Command argument values use the diagram operation names;
JSON string values are accepted for enum arguments.

The caller can discover the REST contract without maintaining a manifest. `diagram_description()` returns JSON Schema
for the diagram's elements, relations, annotations, and commands. `command_payload()` returns the generated Pydantic
request model for one command. The generated [mutation contract](docs/contracts/diagram-mutations/README.md) records
the supported update, move, reorder, and retarget behavior for every registered diagram.

Element removal is conservative by default: `remove_element` rejects an element that still has descendants,
relations, or annotations. Passing `cascade: true` removes the complete diagram-defined subtree and every dependent
relation and annotation atomically. In Tree View diagrams, branches define that subtree. Removing the final element
returns the diagram to an empty, persistable draft; drafts have no Mermaid source until they become valid again.

## Updating and moving elements

Mutation arguments are JSON-shaped and validated before the diagram changes. Updates preserve identity, moves preserve the complete subtree, and reorders require the exact current members of one collection. Rejected mutations leave the complete snapshot unchanged.

<!-- executable-example:mutations:start -->
```python
from mermaiden import Application

with Application.create() as application:
    diagram = application.create_diagram("block")
    application.execute(diagram, "add_group", {"id": "source_example", "label": "Source Example"})
    application.execute(diagram, "add_group", {"id": "target_example", "label": "Target Example"})
    for id, label in (
        ("first_example", "First Example"),
        ("second_example", "Second Example"),
        ("third_example", "Third Example"),
    ):
        application.execute(
            diagram,
            "add_block",
            {"id": id, "label": label, "parent_id": "source_example"},
        )

    application.execute(
        diagram,
        "update_element",
        {"id": "first_example", "kind": "block_node", "changes": {"label": "Updated First Example"}},
    )
    application.execute(
        diagram,
        "move_element",
        {"id": "first_example", "kind": "block_node", "parent_id": "target_example", "position": 0},
    )
    application.execute(
        diagram,
        "reorder_elements",
        {"parent_id": "source_example", "element_ids": ["third_example", "second_example"]},
    )

    for operation, arguments in (
        (
            "update_element",
            {"id": "first_example", "kind": "block_node", "changes": {"id": "renamed_example"}},
        ),
        (
            "move_element",
            {"id": "second_example", "kind": "block_node", "parent_id": "third_example"},
        ),
        (
            "reorder_elements",
            {"parent_id": "source_example", "element_ids": ["second_example"]},
        ),
    ):
        before = application.snapshot(diagram).to_dict()
        try:
            application.execute(diagram, operation, arguments)
        except RuntimeError:
            pass
        else:
            raise AssertionError(f"{operation} unexpectedly succeeded")
        assert application.snapshot(diagram).to_dict() == before

    snapshot = application.snapshot(diagram).to_dict()
    restored = application.restore(snapshot)
    assert application.snapshot(restored).to_dict() == snapshot
    assert application.render(restored) == application.render(diagram)
    report = application.validate_render(restored)
    assert report.success and report.svg
```

## Development

Create the development environment from the committed lock before running repository commands:

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
```

The fast tier performs no npm, browser, network, or external Mermaid work:

```sh
make fast-check
```

Full SVG compatibility is an explicit integration tier. It installs the lock-pinned Mermaid CLI once and requires a
compatible browser:

```sh
make integration
```

Generate the complete fixture preview without opening a browser; CI runs this non-interactive prerequisite:

```sh
make diagrams-preview
```

The interactive command is local-only and opens the generated preview with the platform `open` command:

```sh
make diagrams-test
```

The complete host-mode CI target runs quality, pytest, Mermaid compatibility, and package verification concurrently:

```sh
make ci
```

GitHub Actions runs quality, pytest, Mermaid compatibility, and package verification concurrently; the `ci` job is their
stable aggregate result for branch protection.

written permission. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the complete terms.

## Release

Releases are versioned by annotated `vX.Y.Z` tags. `make ci` first runs `uv lock --check` and
`uv sync --locked --group dev`, so release verification uses the same committed development lock. After it passes,
create and push the tag, then publish the GitHub release:

```sh
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "v2.0.0"
git push origin v2.0.0
gh release create v2.0.0 --verify-tag --generate-notes --title v2.0.0
```
