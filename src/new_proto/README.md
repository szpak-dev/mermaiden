# Diagram core prototype

The model has five concepts:

- **Diagram** owns its state and is the Visitor host.
- **Element** is either an entity or a recursively nested container.
- **Relation** binds IDs of existing elements.
- **Constraint** is a side-effect-free Visitor producing structured violations.
- **Annotation** adds data through typed references to elements or relations.

Dependency direction is `flowchart -> runtime -> core`. Core is independent of
Wireup and Mermaid. Runtime is a service-oriented building environment: frozen
dataclass services receive dependencies through typed fields, while scoped
`DiagramState` owns committed and staged state. No service has a handwritten
constructor.

Every mutation is executed by a Unit of Work. An Observer evaluates constraints
before and after staging the candidate. Blocking violations roll the candidate
back atomically; advisory violations allow deliberately incomplete diagrams to
be built and repaired incrementally.

Flowchart is a separate aggregate resolved from the composition root. Its API
uses domain operations such as `add_start`, `add_decision`, `add_flow`, and
`remove_flow`. Callers pass primitive arguments; the aggregate creates its
`FlowNode`, `Flow`, and `Note` values internally. Generic `Diagram` operations
are mapped to the same flowchart vocabulary and the same constraint pipeline,
so they cannot bypass domain rules.

The principal patterns are:

- **Aggregate** for state ownership and behavior boundaries,
- **Composite** for recursive element containment,
- **Visitor** for structural and diagram-specific constraints,
- **Observer** for before/after constraint evaluation,
- **Unit of Work / Memento** for stage, commit, and rollback,
- **Strategy** through the injected change and inspection contracts.

Rendering implementations remain outside core. A renderer consumes the
read-only `DiagramView` contract through `root_elements`, `walk_elements`,
`find_relations`, and `find_annotations`, without access to runtime state or
mutation services. The generic `Renderer` strategy does not prescribe a
technology or output type.

The generic `rendering` adapter package provides strict Jinja-to-text rendering
and canonical LF-only output. It contains no Mermaid syntax and can be reused by
diagram-specific rendering packages.

The accepted initial flowchart surface is documented in
[`diagrams/flowchart/VOCABULARY.md`](diagrams/flowchart/VOCABULARY.md).

The flowchart rendering package emits deterministic `.mmd` text through Jinja
snippets. Each semantic element, relation, and annotation owns its Mermaid
representation in a template; renderer Python code only configures safe syntax
filters and invokes the root template.
